This project is created by using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) CLI. Create React App includes [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) as a JS test framework by default. You don't have to add a test framework to this project. Maybe you want to add [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) for React test utility.
